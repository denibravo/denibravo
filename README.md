## Hi there ![Waving Animation](./Wave.gif)

I'm [Deni](https://denibravo.github.io/portfolio/), a student from Pennsylvania.

I'm primarily interested in **Machine Learning** and anythign **Data Science** related, and currently working on an application as a side project. 

I'm fascinated by machine learning and data science and have worked on a few machine learning models both in school and outside of school. Taking courses on Machine Learning, Mathematical Statistics, Cloud Computing (AWS) and Research Based Courses as well. On top of other Computer Science courses.

Outside of work, I'm usually at the gym or studying. I'm also very passionate about content creation and mangas. If I am not studying or at the gym, I am either on Twitch Streaming or watching Youtube/reading manga. There is no in between!

Let's connect!
