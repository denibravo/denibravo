## Hi there <img src="./Wave.gif" width="85" alt="Waving Animation">

I'm [Deni](https://denibravo.github.io/portfolio/), a student from Pennsylvania.

I'm primarily interested in **Machine Learning** 🤖 and anything **Data Science** 📊 related, and currently working on an application as a side project.

I'm fascinated by machine learning and data science and have worked on a few machine learning models both in school and outside of school. Taking courses on Machine Learning, Mathematical Statistics, Cloud Computing (AWS), and Research-Based Courses, as well as other Computer Science topics.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Java, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Flask, React, Angular
- **Tools & Platforms**: AWS, Git, Docker
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy

### Featured Projects
- [Early Spring Prediction Project 🌸](https://github.com/kmissmer/EarlySpringPrediciton.git) - Predicting early spring using soil and weather data to help farmers.
- [Squirrel Disease Prediction 🐿️](https://github.com/denibravo/SquirrelDiseasePrediction)) - Predicting whether a squirrel is sick or not using NY Central Park 2018 Data.

Outside of work, I'm usually at the gym 💪 or studying 📚. I'm also very passionate about **content creation** 🎥 and **mangas** 📖. If I am not studying or at the gym, I am either on **Twitch Streaming** or watching YouTube/reading manga. There is no in-between!
