## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Deni Bravo, a student from Pennsylvania.

I'm primarily interested in **Data Science**, and currently work on an application. 

I'm fascinated by machine learning and data science and have worked on a few machine learning models both in school and outside of school.

Outside of work, I'm interested in sports and watching youtube. I'm also very passionate about content creation and mangas.
